          <h3>As a Sport Scientist</h3>
          <p>
            It is common for people like me to come across like jack of all
            trade, master of none. Historically however, there alot of great
            mind that have similar approach to life. Trying the hands on
            whatever that catches their interest. They in many ways have proven
            that diverse and multiple interest or endavour is not only a great
            way to build your mind. It also emphasis the our capacity as
            sapiens, the flexibility and adaptability of our brain cells and
            motor neurons.

          <h3>As a Nurse</h3>
          <p>
            I have worked right from my second year of study in hospitals and
            home care unit. Nursing is facinating and challenging at the same
            time. Though an onlooker may not see the challenges in nursing from
            a first glance but dealing with people with different physical,
            mental and socialogical needs is by no mean a easy task. It is
            easier when you are able to give the necessary help or care it is
            more difficult when everything you gave are futile. The job require
            attention to detail, being careful, attentive, support, human etc.
            at the same time not loosing your person self image in the process.

          <h3>As a programer</h3>

          <p>
            The pandemic to a large extent open the eyes of many to the
            opportunity in computer science especially programing. This used to
            be a dreaded field. computer programers are thought of as lonners,
            whose only interest is to be locked up in the room steering at black
            screen and white letters. They are thought of as game addicts and
            antisocial etc. But the pandemic and willing computer science
            institution platforms set out to demistify this comcept. the
            increase in popularity of bootcamps and online platforms such as
            youtube, udemy, w3shcool, freecodecomp open the field to everyone
            who can have a computer and wants to learn coding.
